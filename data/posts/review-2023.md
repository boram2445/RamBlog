## What Is an Annual Review?

An annual review, or a year-end review, is the process of evaluating employee performance over the past year. Annual reviews are typically done by managers, but can also be self-conducted.

Generally, an annual performance assessment includes:

Tracking employee KPIs
Identifying employee's strengths and weaknesses
Measuring employee quality of work
Providing feedback on potential areas of improvement
Needless to say, an annual review is a critical part of any successful business.

It helps businesses identify high-performing employees, boost employee engagement, relay expectations, and help foster a progressive environment of growth and progress.

On the other hand, employees can also use this time to communicate their future expectations to the company; be it their next year's KPIs, personal goals, monetary compensation, bonus structure breakdown, or expected promotions.

At the end of an annual review, managers evaluate whether the company's future goals align with employees' objectives, and decide if they should be recommended for a raise or promotion in the coming year.
